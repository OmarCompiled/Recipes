      <h2>About:</h2>
      <p>This project is part of the odin project's curriculum. It was designed primarily as an exercise
      on html and page structure, but I just decided to put in some CSS. I used websites like
      <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/">Allrecipes</a> as a source for the recipes and thier ingredients.
      Enjoy your stay.
