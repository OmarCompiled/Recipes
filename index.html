    <h2>About:</h2>
    <p>This project is part of the odin project's curriculum. It was designed primarily as an exercise<br>
    on html and page structure, but I just decided to put in some CSS. I used websites like<br> 
    <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/">Allrecipes</a> as a source for the recipes and thier ingredients.
    Enjoy your stay.
