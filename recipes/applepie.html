      </li><br>
      <li>
        <strong>Butter</strong> and <strong>flour</strong>

      </li><br>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugars</strong>
        :  A blend of white and brown sugar creates the perfect sweet flavor with a hint of warmth.
      </li><br>
      <li>
        <strong>Pie crust</strong>
        : Use a store-bought double crust pie pastry or make your own at home.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the filling</strong>
        : On the stove, make a paste with flour and butter. Add the<br> 
        sugar and water and bring to a boil. Simmer, then remove from heat.
      </li><br>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble the pie</strong>
        : Press one crust into a pie plate. Place the sliced apples<br>
        on the bottom crust. Use the top crust to make a lattice crust according to<br>
        the recipe below. Pour the butter-sugar mixture over the lattice crust.
      </li><br>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake the pie</strong>
        : Bake the pie in a preheated oven until the apples are soft<br>
        and the crust is golden brown.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How Long to Bake the Apple Pie:</h3>
    <p>You'll bake the pie at 425 degrees F for 15 minutes, then you'll reduce the<br>
      temperature to 350 degrees F and continue baking for 35-45 minutes. All in all,<br>
      the pie will bake for about one hour, give or take a few minutes. You'll know the<br>
      pie is done when the apples are soft and the crust is a beautiful golden brown<br> color.
